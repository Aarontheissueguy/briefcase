Briefcase is a tool for converting a Python project into a standalone native
application. You can package projects for:

* Mac
* Windows
* Linux
* iPhone/iPad
* Android
* Web

Support for AppleTV, watchOS, and wearOS deployments is planned.

If you want to see Briefcase in action, try the `BeeWare tutorial
<https://beeware.readthedocs.io>`__. That tutorial walks you through the
process of creating and packaging a new application with Briefcase.

Installation
----------

To install briefcase in your project's virtual environment, run the following::

   $ python -m pip install briefcase

It is important that you use ``python -m pip``, rather than a bare ``pip``. Briefcase needs to ensure that it has an up-to-date version of ``pip`` and ``setuptools``, and a bare invocation of ``pip`` canâ€™t self-update. If you want to know more, `Brett Cannon has a detailed blog post about the issue <https://snarky.ca/why-you-should-use-python-m-pip/>`__.
