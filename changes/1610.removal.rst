It is highly recommended that Android applications add a definition for ``gradle_dependencies`` to their app configuration. A default value will be used if this option is not explicitly provided. Refer to `the Android documentation <https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/platforms/android.html#gradle-dependencies>`__ for the default value that will be used.
